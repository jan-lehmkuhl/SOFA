R CLI
================================================================================

## installation
    cd tools/sofa-framework
    make installrequirementsR


## troubleshooting
* maybe a restart is required
* often also an execution of the `*.Rmd` file with the `rstudio` GUI helps with installation issues 



R Studio Desktop
================================================================================

sometimes a additional manual execution within `R Studio Desktop` of `meshReport.Rmd` may also help:
